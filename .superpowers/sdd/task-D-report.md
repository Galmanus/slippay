# Task D: Corporate Guards Implementation

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Commit:** baf4777

**Test Result:** 3/3 passing (vitest)

**Summary:** Approval threshold + audit log wired into Send.tsx and Exchange.tsx (sell-side). Any transfer >= VITE_COMEX_APPROVAL_USD (default 5000) now requires a second-approver checkbox confirmation before proceeding. All transactions logged to localStorage (comex_audit_log). Non-custodial, app-level safeguard against threat #6.
