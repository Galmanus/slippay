# axl-gate — the forcing function that makes the AXL proof load-bearing.
#
# It fails the build (non-zero exit) unless ALL of the following hold:
#   1. the deployed agent policy still PROVES its bound (z3 re-discharge), and
#   2. the checked-in certificate reproduces from that policy (no proof/spec
#      drift), and
#   3. the constant the on-chain contract actually enforces equals the
#      certified `window_cap_multiplier` (no contract/proof drift).
#
# Without this gate the proof and the deployed enforcement are two independent
# numbers that can silently diverge. With it, changing one without the other
# turns CI red. This is what turns AXL from "an offline verifier" into a
# control that is checked on every change.
#
# Usage: axl-compiler/scripts/axl-gate.sh
# Exit:  0 = conformant; 1 = tooling/usage error; 2 = drift detected.
